<h1>About of: Marco Ippolito</h1>
<p> Hi my name is Marco, and I'm passionate about web development, ethical hacking, and AI development.<br>
     My passion for technology began at a young age, disassembling and reassembling electronic toys and exploring how different platforms worked.<br>
      I still remember the satisfaction of solving my first technological puzzle, understanding how a circuit worked, or fixing a broken device.<br>
       This experience taught me the importance of patience, precision, and problem-solving.<br>
        Today, this same passion guides me in my work.<br>
         I enjoy tackling complex problems, finding creative and efficient solutions, always attentive to people's needs.<br>
          I'm a cheerful and collaborative person, but above all methodical and precise.<br>
           I firmly believe in teamwork and the power of collaboration to achieve ambitious goals.<br>
            I'm always open to new challenges, learning opportunities, and personal growth.<br>
             This portfolio showcases some of my most recent projects, but it only represents a small part of my journey.<br>
              I'm always looking for new opportunities to test my skills and expand my knowledge.<br>
     Contact me if you have any questions or are interested in collaborating!
